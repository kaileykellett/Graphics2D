This was an exercise done in my last year of high school, meant to teach us about inheritance of classes. As a class, we laid out the structure for a few different classes of Objects, then had to implement methods in order to make the objects do what we wanted them to. 

While we were led by our teacher in this exercise and he gave us the format for how classes and methods should be laid out, all methods were built by me, with the exception of the "Bounce" method, which my teacher provided some code for. He didn't want to spend more than a week on the exercise and many of the students in the class were not taking calculus or trigonometry, so he gave us the math to make the method work properly.
